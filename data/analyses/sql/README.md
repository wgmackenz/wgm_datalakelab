# Data - Analyses - SQL

Place any SQL queries into this folder that depend upon the core data model, such as recurring audit or admin queries.

* Items in this folder will not be executed during the DBT data pipeline but they may be tested afterwards (during CI/CD testing) to ensure they are not broken by upstream data model changes.
