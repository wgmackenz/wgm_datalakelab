# Data - Analyses - Notebooks

Place any project notebooks into this folder, such as from Jupyter or Polynote.

* Items in this folder will not be executed during the DBT data pipeline but they may be tested afterwards (during CI/CD testing) to ensure they are not broken by upstream data model changes.
